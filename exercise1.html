        <h1>welcom to Manchester United</h1>
        <p>Manchester United Football Club was founded in <strong>1878</strong> as <strong>Newton Heath LYR Football Club</strong>, formed by railway workers. The club changed its name to <strong>Manchester United</strong> in <strong>1902</strong> after facing financial trouble and receiving new investment.<br>

United won their first league title in 1908 and their first FA Cup in 1909. After World War II, under Sir Matt Busby, the club developed a strong youth policy, leading to the famous “Busby Babes” of the 1950s. Tragedy struck in 1958 when a plane crash in Munich killed eight players.<br>

Busby rebuilt the team and led them to win the European Cup in 1968, the first English club to do so. Under <strong><mark>Sir Alex Ferguson (1986–2013)</mark></strong>,<i><u>United enjoyed their greatest success, </u></i> winning 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, and the 1999 UEFA Champions League, completing a historic treble that year.<br>

Since Ferguson’s retirement, United have had several managers, winning the 2016 FA Cup, 2017 Europa League, and League Cup, while continuing to rebuild to regain past dominance.</p>
